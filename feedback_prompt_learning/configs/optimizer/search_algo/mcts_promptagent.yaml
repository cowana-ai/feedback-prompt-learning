# Prompts for gradient analysis and optimization (PROMPTAGENT VERSION - Error-focused)
gradient_analysis_prompt: |
  I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

  My current prompt is:
  {prompt}

  {example_string_with_feedback}

  For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

  I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

  My current prompt is:
  {current_prompt}

  {example_string}

  Based on the prompt errors, the problems with this prompt and the proposed solutions are:
  {gradient}

  There is a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
  {trajectory_text}

  Based on the above information, please write {num_prompts} new prompt{plural} following these guidelines:
  1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems identified in the gradient analysis.
  2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
  3. Each new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END> tags.
